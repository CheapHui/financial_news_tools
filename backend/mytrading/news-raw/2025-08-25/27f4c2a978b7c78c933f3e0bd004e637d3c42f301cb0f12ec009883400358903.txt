The Nintendo Switch 2 was tough to find in stock during its first two months on shelves, but that’s no longer the case. If you own one, or are considering buying one soon, you understandably may want a microSD card to store more games than the console’s 256GB storage can fit. And, you may already know that only microSD Express cards will work on the Switch 2 for storing and playing games. The card you used in your original Switch or Switch Lite will only offer very limited functionality in a Switch 2, letting you view screenshots or video clips you captured previously — that’s it.
Here’s where you can buy microSD Express cards for the Switch 2
It’s tough to mistake Express cards for the standard model. Just look for the “EX” — and the higher price tag.

The significantly faster microSD Express card boasts an advertised 4.4x improvement in terms of transfer speeds over the microSD cards you might already have lying around. That improvement is signified by a small, easy-to-miss “EX” emblem etched onto the front of the card.
Not only is the Switch 2 easy to find in stock these days, microSD Express cards are, too. However, Express cards aren’t cheap, with some costing more than $50 for just 256GB of storage. The Switch 2 supports microSD Express cards up to 2TB in size, although 1TB is the largest capacity available, with some cards selling for up to $200 a pop. Walmart’s Onn model is a beacon of light, as its 512GB model costing $65.88 — when it’s in stock.
