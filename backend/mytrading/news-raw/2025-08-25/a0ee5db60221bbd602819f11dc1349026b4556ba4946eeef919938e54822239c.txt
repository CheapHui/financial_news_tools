Fi, the pet tech company known for its smart dog collar, has launched a clip-on GPS tracker that it says is the perfect size for your feline friend or small dog. The Fi Mini weighs just 0.56 ounces (16 grams), allowing you to keep tabs on your pet with real-time escape alerts and live tracking from the accompanying app.
The new Fi Mini pet tracker has GPS, and it’s barely bigger than an AirTag
It has more accuracy than Bluetooth trackers and is small enough to fit on your cat.

As with its smart collar, the Fi Mini is also available as a subscription, but it’s a bit cheaper at $129 per year. You can attach the Fi Mini to any collar or harness that’s 3/8 to 1 inch wide, and Fi says it’s suitable for “dogs and cats of any size.” At 42mm long and 30mm wide, the Fi Mini is slightly larger than an Apple AirTag. The Fi Mini is still lighter than the Cat Mini tracker offered by Tractive, which recently acquired Whistle and is shutting down its tracking platform.
Once you clip the Fi Mini onto your dog’s or cat’s collar, you can expect up to three weeks of battery life (or up to three months with the Fi base, which helps reduce power consumption) and support for USB-C charging. Like the Series 3 Plus smart collar, the Fi Mini has an IP68 rating, making it dust-tight and protected against submersion in water. The compact tracker uses Verizon’s LTE-M cellular network to share your pet’s location and track their walking history.
The Fi Mini also offers the same activity and sleep tracking capabilities as the smart collar, with additional features, including AI-powered behavior detection to alert you of barking, scratching, eating, drinking, and licking, this fall. Fi also plans on rolling out an Apple Watch integration, bringing it in line with its Series 3 Plus counterpart.
The Fi Mini is available to purchase now and will begin shipping on September 1st.
