While there are some high-priced options out there, you don’t have to spend a lot to actually hear a movie’s dialog. Right now, the Bose TV Speaker is down to $163.45 (about $115 off) at Amazon, the lowest price we’ve seen yet.

The Bose TV Speaker is a solid starter soundbar that can easily integrate into existing setups with a simple one-cable connection (via optical or HDMI). At under 24 inches wide and around two inches tall, the soundbar features a small footprint, yet it delivers a rich, immersive sound thanks to its three-speaker setup. For more bass, you can press the “Bass” button on the remote, while a dedicated dialogue mode further elevates what people are saying, allowing you to finally turn off the subtitles.
Additionally, the Bose TV Speaker has Bluetooth connectivity, so you can use the soundbar to listen to music or podcasts. While it lacks more premium features like Dolby Atmos, Bose offers some of our favorite noise-cancelling headphones and earbuds, so you can expect a similar level of quality in its home audio products.

Meanwhile, the PowerCord features a durable braided cable that connects to the bottom of the adapter, so it doesn’t awkwardly poke out from the wall.
